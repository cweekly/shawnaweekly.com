    Welcome!
  </p>
  <p>
    I am a licensed psychotherapist serving clients from all over the south shore from my offices in downtown Plymouth.  
    I work extensively with children and adolescents with behavioral issues, depression, and anxiety. 
    I also specialize in working with adults suffering from all levels of depression and anxiety. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I believe that it is the relationship that heals. 
    I provide a safe and comfortable environment to work with clients, one in which we uncover conflicts, process trauma, depression and anxiety. 
    We will work together to come up with useful tools to improve daily functioning and find happiness.
  </p>
  <p>
    I use a variety of techniques including play therapy and sibling therapy with children and adolescents as well as cognitive behavioral and psychodynamic techniques with adults. I also provide family and couples therapy to those clients in need.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm currently taking new clients. I can take BCBS, Tufts and Aetna health insurance. Please call or email for an appointment.      
    I look forward to hearing from you.
