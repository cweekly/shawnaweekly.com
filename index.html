    Welcome!
  </p>
  <p>
    <img class="portrait" src="img/mother-kiss.jpg" />
    I am a licensed psychotherapist serving clients from all over the south shore from my offices in Hingham. 
    I work extensively with children and adolescents with behavioral issues, depression, and anxiety. 
    I also specialize in working with adults suffering from all levels of depression and anxiety, 
    including a speciality in postpartum depression. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I believe that it is the relationship that heals. 
    I provide a safe and comfortable environment to work with clients, one in which we uncover conflicts, 
    process trauma, depression and anxiety. 
    We will work together to come up with useful tools to improve daily functioning and find happiness.
  </p>
  <p>
    I use a variety of techniques including play therapy and sibling therapy with children and adolescents 
    as well as cognitive behavioral and psychodynamic techniques with adults. I also provide family and couples 
    therapy to those clients in need.
  </p>
  <p>
    I will be starting two groups in the fall. One for teenage girls and the other for postpartum mothers. 
    Both will be meeting on Wednesdays.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm currently taking new clients. I can take health insurance payments from all the major insurers, including:
    Aetna, BlueCross and/or BlueShield, Cigna, Harvard Pilgrim, The Wellness Corporation, Tufts, UBH/United, 
    Out of Network, and private payment (via cash, check or PayPal). Sliding scale financing is offered as needed.
    Please call me at <a href="tel:508-952-0965">(508) 952-0965</a> or 
    <a href="mailto:info@shawnaweekly.com">email</a> 
    for an appointment.      
    I look forward to hearing from you.
